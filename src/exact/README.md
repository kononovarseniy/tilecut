# Component `exact`

This component contains implementations of specialized operations on floating-point numbers.
Such operations include:
* rounding a point to a grid cell,
* finding a grid cell containing the intersection of a line with an axis-aligned line,
* etc.

Much of the code in this component relies on the correct combination of compiler flags to ensure that floating-point numbers are handled correctly.
For this reason, the component's function definitions should not be placed in header files, otherwise dependent objects may not be built correctly.

Using this code requires calculating special constants for a specific use case.
They can be generated by the [ka_generate_grid](../generate_grid/README.md) utility.
