/// Polygon orientation is often determined by calculating its oriented (signed) area. However, this method suffers from
/// numerical precision limitations. For floating-point numbers, error accumulation rapidly distorts the area's sign,
/// while integer computations frequently cause overflow issues.
///
/// To determine orientation, we establish whether the half-plane to the polygon's right lies inside or outside the
/// polygon. We construct this half-plane using the rightmost vertex of the multipolygon. Since the vertex is the
/// rightmost, all segments and vertices of the polygon can be either to the left or on the boundary of the half-plane.
/// Therefore, the half-plane is either entirely inside the multipolygon or entirely outside. We select the topmost
/// point on this boundary and find the edge oriented furthest clockwise relative to the upward direction. This requires
/// an exact orientation predicate for three points. As we operate in the left half-plane, collinear segments may either
/// share interior points (prohibited by data constraints) or be vertically counter-directed. By choosing a point with
/// no strictly higher neighbors, such counter-directed edges are impossible. Zero-length edges are prohibited in input
/// data, as they are better handled by the caller if needed.
///
/// The selected edge will separate the polygon's interior and exterior regions due to the prohibition of overlapping
/// edges. Within a neighborhood of the chosen vertex, a continuous path exists from the edge to the analyzed
/// half-plane. If the selected edge enters the chosen vertex, the half-plane lies outside, and the outer contour is
/// oriented counter-clockwise. If the edge exits the vertex, the half-plane is inside, and the polygon is
/// clockwise-oriented.
///
/// Alternatively, one can eliminate Y-coordinate ordering. This requires several adjustments. First, filter edges by
/// comparing both endpoints with the selected point, as reordering points within a segment doesnâ€™t guarantee its second
/// point matches the selection. Second, when sorting edges clockwise, properly select vertices distinct from the chosen
/// one. Since the selected point might not be the absolute top/bottom on the half-plane boundary, collinear edges may
/// occur. Their ordering under collinearity (per predicate) requires Y-coordinate comparison. This approach increases
/// implementation complexity, hence we use the previously described X-then-Y ordering.
